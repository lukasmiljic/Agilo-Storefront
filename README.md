# Agilo storefront frontend pre-internship task

Storefront cutup made with Next.js, Tailwind and TypeScript for Agilo internship

## Description
Responsive storefront cutup that displays products in a grid, allowing for filtering of products by categories. As well as a details page for each product. The project itself took around 8 hours over the course of two days, but as I was unfamiliar with Tailwind and Next.js I dedicated some time initially to learning these technologies. Not included in the 8 hours total. I had the most trouble with maintaining propper folder structure and keeping the code as clean as possible. I quite like the blur effect with the sidebar, I'd like to play around with that a bit more in future projects.
